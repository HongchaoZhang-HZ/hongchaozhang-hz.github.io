Hi there! Iâ€™m a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Institute of Software Integrated Systems, Vanderbilt University. I work with [Prof. Taylor T. Johnson](https://www.taylortjohnson.com/), [Prof. Meiyi Ma](https://meiyima.github.io/), and [Prof. Ahmad F. Taha](https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/taha/) at the intersection of control, AI, formal methods, and cyber-physical systems (CPS), across various domains, including autonomous systems, water, transportation, and power. 
I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering under the supervision of [Prof. Andrew Clark](https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Andrew-Clark.html). My research focuses on the end-to-end verification and validation of autonomous systems, with an emphasis on ensuring the safety and robustness of CPS.
