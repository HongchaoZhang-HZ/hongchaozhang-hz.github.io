I am leading a comparative project bringing together shorebirdologists from various parts of the Globe to explore the diversity of shorebird incubation rhythms.

<!-- First, we collected data on biparentally incubating shorebirds and showed unexpected between- and within-species diversity of incubation rhythms and that latitudinal cline in diel-light changes and anti-predation strategy of the species shape the rhythms (see <a href='http://rdcu.be/mUso'>the paper</a> and <a href='https://ecoevocommunity.nature.com/posts/13472-bringing-chronobiology-into-the-wild'>the blog-post on how this came to be</a>).  -->

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1.jpg" title="map" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2.jpg" title="patterns" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    <div class="col-sm-3 mt-3 mt-md-0">

    </div>

Second, we are further exploring the data on biparental shorebirds to reveal between-sex differences as well as within-pair variability in incubation.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/4.jpg" title="cor" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

<!-- Third, we are collecting data on uniparentally incubating shorebirds to reveal the variability of uniparental incubation rhythms and explore how such rhythms are constrained. -->
